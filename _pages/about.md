### About Me

I am **Olivia Chatterjee**, a final-year undergraduate in **Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)**.

My academic and research journey is shaped by a deep interest in the **intersection of logic and learning** â€” how deterministic systems can evolve and infer knowledge through experience. I have explored this through projects in **machine learning**, **compiler design**, and **semantic AI**, complemented by hands-on research at institutes like **Florida International University** and **Occidental College**.

#### Research Experience
- Semantic reasoning and knowledge representation using CNNs to classify structured cancer data  
- Neural-symbolic hybrid systems for diagnostics in healthcare  
- Privacy-preserving AI with explainable models using differential privacy  
- Compiler theory and Prolog-based symbolic inference for medical diagnostics  

---

#### Core Interests
- AI + Symbolic Logic & Semantics  
- Programming Language Theory & Interpretable Models  
- Secure Computation & Cryptographic AI  
- Building intelligent, explainable, and privacy-preserving tools for healthcare & finance  

---

#### Highlight
- **3rd Rank (National Level)** in Cryptography & Security Bootcamp hosted by the Indian Statistical Institute and ISEA (MeitY, Govt. of India)
